Disclaimer: I proudly share with you this code, so that you may reduce 90% of your work implementing CTRNet. This repo is not production ready. Please understand that this piece of code is only for research use, so we are not motivated to optimize it towards production purposes. As such, there may be some inconvinence when you implement CTRNet. For example, cache.py is needed even for testing. This process takes ~5min in a multicore computing server, and may take a lot more time on a personal device. Also, the results of cache.py will take up a lot of space.
